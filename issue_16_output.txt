I want these changes in the homepage:

- Add an image in a circle on the left of the first paragraph, 72 x 72 pixels
- Image at `website/src/assets/Sumit_Lachung_profile_picture.jpg`
- After last paragraph, add call to action labeled "YouTube series on Vibe Coding" with link `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYtYRIWhUTWVLWPzLmxwW8tQZw1VbPVAb`
- Second call to action labeled "Software Projects" to '/projects'
- Third call to action labeled "Want to discuss Vibe Coding and Products" to `https://calendly.com/sumitdatta/quick-chat`

Call to actions should have button like styling, one per row in mobile otherwise float side by side when possible. Keep the dark color theme.


I want these changes for the entire site:

- A background image, `website/src/assets/Gemini_Generated_Image_swzj74swzj74swzj.png`
- The content column should have the current background color, the image should be visible in the extra space left or right of page
