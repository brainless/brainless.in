            <p>
                I am Sumit Datta, an extremely passionate software engineer with
                16 years of experience, mostly at early, fast-paced startups.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am entrepreneurial by nature, have built and failed at a few
                startups. I am very hands-on when it comes to software/product
                development. I am eager, curious and also a good listener. I
                have been part of or built or lead teams in the US, Canada,
                Germany and India. Although I have not been to the Americas.
