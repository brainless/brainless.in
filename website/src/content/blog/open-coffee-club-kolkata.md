Hello fellow Kolkatans,  

Wednesday, August, 26th, 2009 we are kicking off Open Coffee Club in Kolkata.  

You may already be aware of OCC. Its simply bringing your work to a casual place, work, meet people, share, get work done, make contacts. Having a common place for everyone to meet is important. The original concept is geared more towards entrepreneurs but we want to keep it wider in meaning and appeal.  

So any working professional, entrepreneur, consultant or anyone interested can join in.  

Kolkata is way less active in these aspects and we want to change that. I hope you will find it as interesting as we imagine it to be.  

The plan and place:  

We wanted to have one date and place, but Kolkata traffic is a mess and moreover Kolkata has a distinct North and South :) Thus we decided on two place, two dates:  

Every Wednesday at the CCD below RDB Boulevard (Big Cinemas), Salt Lake Sector V. ([Google Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=RDB+Boulevard,+Salt+Lake+Sector+V,+Kolkata,+WB,+India&sll=22.547222,88.356557&sspn=0.010345,0.01929&ie=UTF8&ll=22.573002,88.43271&spn=0.009847,0.01929&z=16&iwloc=A))  

Every Saturday at the CCD, No 1, Upper Wood Street (close to Pantaloons, 22 Camac St.) ([Google Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=No+1,+Upper+Wood+Street,+Kolkata,+WB,+India&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=36.315864,79.013672&ie=UTF8&ll=22.547222,88.356557&spn=0.010345,0.01929&z=16&iwloc=A))  

Both start at around 2PM and continue till 9-10 PM. So you can pour in after office.  

You are requested to carry mobile internet options if you have one. We are trying to arrange for internet, but there may be issues.  

Please inform your friends in and around Kolkata about this. Lets rock Kolkata!
