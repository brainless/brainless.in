Today (June 9, 2011, India) Google's doodle on Les Paul is just a great time killer. Spent the whole morning interacting with it. I got interested to understand what was going on behind the scenes. Well here is what I see:

Its a canvas that you see. All of the images for the doodle come from a [sprite](http://www.google.com/logos/2011/guitar11-hp-sprite.png), there is a Flash [SWF content](http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en//logos/swf/guitar11.swf) which provides the audio (MP3, approx 8.4KB each, 12 of them). You can use Flashbug on Firefox to view those details.  

The rest is JavaScript as you would guess. Really nicely done.
