For the impatient: [link to spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&hl=en_US&key=0AsLdRpQRPHgHdER6YlFIcTdkeG9VbV85Q202cDV6VkE&output=html).  

For the last few weeks I have been looking around a lot on the web, checking for details and prices of VPS or dedicated servers. I am looking for places to host Mag when it starts growing. Not that I am leaving AWS in any way. But for Mag we will need servers at a lower bandwidth cost that on AWS.  

I am looking for self managed (or unmanaged) dedicated/VPS solutions. I will prefer dedicated types. I am looking for a decent Dual Core commercial processor (Intel Core2Duo or AMD Athlons will do), but higher grade Xeon or Opteron types are also on my mind.  

So I am maintaining a spreadsheet will selected servers from some hosting companies that I keep adding to every week. You can access the spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&hl=en_US&key=0AsLdRpQRPHgHdER6YlFIcTdkeG9VbV85Q202cDV6VkE&output=html). Its publicly view-able. If you want me to add a company you know of, please let me know. If you want edit permissions, I could give you that too. Servers could be located in any major region around the world like North America, South America, UK, Germany, Russia, Japan, Australia, Middle East, India, or anywhere there is a substantial user volume.
