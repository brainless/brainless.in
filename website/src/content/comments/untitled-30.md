@Mukesh we use Google Analytics almost regularly. But really drilling down into it, monitoring Analytics each day is something we are yet to do. Whenever we have spikes we do drill into Analytics to see where users came from, and where they are headed.
Related forums is something we can not provide on other forums since we want each forum to be very independent. But we can surely suggest users other forums in their own personal dashboards. We will be working on this.
Thanks for reminding that.
