Startup is a call, a journey that is not destined for the destination but for the journey as well, which initially is covered on a roller-coaster .. On one day its fun, the other day you are ugly .. u run out of money ... ur one family will have problems as you will be having 2 families then :) .. you will also have a lot of fun and freedom ...

Then it ends up on a call .. You take it or leave it ... once you take it .. keep pursuing, working hard ... most importantly

1) Enjoy
2) Take Pride
3) Consistently pursue
