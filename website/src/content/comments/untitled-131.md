Thank you for the sensible critique. Me & my neighbour were preparing to do some research about that. We got a good book on that matter from our local library and most books where not as influensive as your information. I am very glad to see such information here. Looking at a CMS is very significant I use Drupal. Because When I learned the biggest nonprofits use Durpal, it's a no brainer For Drupal hosting I always use Pantheon with fast cache responses What platform did you chose?
