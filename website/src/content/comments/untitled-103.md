Well this is not something new from Airtel....the adverts that come up for their mobile services boast about great network connection from anywhere under the sun...which is just crap. When I am inside the office (it is Salt Lake), most of the time I find my mobile in a mode like this: "Searching for network".....so if they cannot fix this, Airtel Digital DTH is far off....they are still in infancy....
