attending OCC at Cafe Coffee Dday @ RDB Boulevard Salt Lake Sector V on wednesday was quite an experience to remember... i must admit that i was a bit nervous while i walked down to the venue from infinity... and trust mee OCC was not really something i had thought it to be... instead poeple came pouring in with their laptops and not to forget broad smiles... the next couple of hours passed in a flick as we sipped over some coffee and kept blabbering and working... i was the quietest of the lot and preferred to observe than being noticed... 

thanx to sumit for inviting me to join OCC...thanx to all you guys for being so friendly... and lastly sorry to those i had been "snob" with...
