It's been a long while since I got lost. Well personal, professional and all other kinds o nals. But its good to be back. Have been doing a lot of Amazon WS these days, so will blog about them. Think I will start a series on Amazon WS with PHP.
Oh ! and we shifted to Gentoo / nginx. Good combo.
Will blog on that too.
