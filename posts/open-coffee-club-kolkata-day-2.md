Hey Kolkatans,  

Kolkata had another splendid OCC, on Sat Aug 29. We did have some glitches, with the Internet not working at the Park Street CCD venue. And since Park Street CCD has much footfall we had to shift out to a bigger CCD. The manager at Park Street suggested a few nearby and then Mitesh and Manish went out searching for one. At last we found the CCD on Upper Wood Street. If you are coming from Park Street (like we did) then just walk across 22 Camac Street (Pantaloons) and you will find a crossing, keep going straight, and you will find a CCD on your right. That will become our permanent CCD venue for South Kolkata. It has a great outdoor arrangement, simple superb for the coming season.  

We did have new faces this time and that is great, so the news is spreading. Here are some of the people I remember:  

Sanjib Chakraborty  

Sumit Datta  

Saikat Singha  

Mitesh Ashar  

Manish Sonkar  

Pavan Gupta  

Sumana Chakraborty  

Prachi Kamalia  

Amitabh Choudhury  

Ashmita Brahma  

Sougata Pal  

Bibhash  

Anirban Ganguly  

Pankaj Bansal  

Sorry for having forgotten the last names of a few people. And I can not recollect the guy from BITS. Someone please tweet the name(s).  

Instead of the initial venue change, etc. we had a very good time. Me and Mitesh could start on the project he is to work on. I gave Ashmita an introduction to HTML. Prachi, Pankaj and me discussed celeb9.com and then a lot of scaling related stuff.  

Well that's from my side. Others will blog their experiences. We are trying to get a basic website up for all such information. But the best way to enjoy OCC is to drop at one of the next OCC. OCC Kolkata takes place twice a week, at a CCD, with Internet available on wi-fi. Venues:  

Every Wednesday at the CCD below RDB Boulevard (Big Cinemas), Salt Lake Sector V. ([Google Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=RDB+Boulevard,+Salt+Lake+Sector+V,+Kolkata,+WB,+India&sll=22.547222,88.356557&sspn=0.010345,0.01929&ie=UTF8&ll=22.573002,88.43271&spn=0.009847,0.01929&z=16&iwloc=A))  

Every Saturday at the CCD, No 1, Upper Wood Street (close to Pantaloons, 22 Camac St.) ([Google Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=No+1,+Upper+Wood+Street,+Kolkata,+WB,+India&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=36.315864,79.013672&ie=UTF8&ll=22.547222,88.356557&spn=0.010345,0.01929&z=16&iwloc=A))  

Both start at around 2PM and continue till 9-10 PM. So you can pour in after office. Remember to bring in your laptops, mobile devices, notepad. Meet, discuss, work! Oh and drink coffee (not free :P).
