I have somehow always mixed the worlds of Personal and Professional relations and paid huge price for that mix up. It is an aspect that I am still learning, but as I feel a little more confident in my handling of this aspect, I felt like writing out my thoughts. A lot of people including myself have raging debates about the definition or meaning of these two sides of our adult life and how they are (not?) connected.  
When I say **Personal**, I mean friends, family, a special someone, relatives or people in general that I care about where I do not think about the financial cost or some sense of duty or obligation. There is a natural bond, which might be a blood relation or not. Also, I surely include my pets in Personal relations - they are awesome Personal relations.  
When I say **Professional**, I mean people from work, colleagues, boss, managers and such who I solely know for my work/business purposes and have not known them enough to call them Personal relations. The important part is that I am more duty bound to them, with rules and obligations driving the relationship.  
Since these are very human ways to define, naturally words do not always let us express what we mean. So let's take some examples.  
Say MuaMua is a friend of mine, I know her for a long time and we care for each other. Now she goes through a tough time due to a family crisis. I will go to whatever lengths I can to be there, to support her. The main thing driving me is that I care about her and our friendship. I care that she exists in my life. There are strong emotions involved that will keep my mind focused toward her well being.  
Now say MuaMua is only my boss. She got into the same issue, she struggles to keep up the business, things are falling apart. I will still try to help as an individual or with everyone else in the company, maybe even pool in money. But unless there was an existing emotional connection, all this is still fairly duty bound. As humans we have our duty toward people around us, our neighbors, peers, and others in general. *But I will perhaps start looking for a new job* - and this is a vital part of the definition.  
  
Professional relations are, by nature, around money. There is no denying this. If I perform poorly time after time, maybe due to mental issues, surely my boss might try and get me to a counselor but she will also try to replace me.  
  
This sounds harsh but it is reality. We all have limited buckets of strength, some have larger buckets than others. And we need to share than strength and support for people around us. So we prioritize.  
Professional relations naturally exist because there is a barter, an exchange of skills and money. In Personal relations I could sit with you under a mango tree every evening and just enjoy the sunset.  
  
In Personal relations, there is nothing being bartered than a silent vow. There is no way to value how much I am willing to risk for you, maybe infinity. There is no upper limit, it is all gut feelings and butterflies. In Professional relations, it will boil down to stakes, salaries, insurances and such.Â Build healthier relations, start by drawing boundaries and knowing what the relation is for. And remember that you can have Personal and Professional relations with the same people, just make that clear. Communication matters.
