Today is Friday, January 6, 2012 (Indian Time). Last week I was at [MobStac](http://mobstac.com/) at this time. That was my last day at MobStac. 2012 started with fun, food, a short drive to a nearby spot, drinks and everything in-between. But the fun is gradually getting over and the feeling has started to change. I have done this a couple times earlier. I have heard the rules of the game repeated so many times by others. I have seen successful entrepreneurs, and seen teams grow. I am not new to this world. But that guarantees nothing.  

Me and my wife, Debleena have been planning to do this for the last 4-5 months. We have saved up enough to last for about 10 months. Plus we do have some small projects to help us earn some extra cash. This is bare survival and that is great. We have a couple of ideas that we want to experiment with. We did not get through [YCombinator](http://ycombinator.com/), and [The Morpheus](http://themorpheus.com/) was not a suitable match, given that we (including our part time members) had a lot of experience in the stuff we would do. But that does not mean we are at a loss.  

We have knowledge, experience and a shitload of spirit. We have [Amit](http://in.linkedin.com/in/techstunts) and [Ipsita](http://in.linkedin.com/in/sarkaripsita) to help us part-time. And we have great mentors like [Pallav](http://www.linkedin.com/in/pallavn), [Sharad](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sharadsharma), [Shubhodeep](http://in.linkedin.com/in/shubhodeepdas), [Ravi](http://in.linkedin.com/in/ravipratapm) and [Sharat](http://in.linkedin.com/in/sharatpotharaju). And not to forgot our dear friends [Ruhita](http://in.linkedin.com/pub/ruhita-bhattacharjee/13/108/7a3), [Arijit](http://in.linkedin.com/pub/arijit-chakraborty/15/108/b8), [Paro](http://in.linkedin.com/pub/paromita-sinha/28/4b9/63a),Â [Nitesh](http://in.linkedin.com/in/niteshambuj), [Mohan](http://in.linkedin.com/in/mberiwal) and so many others I can not name here right now. Heck! what do we need to worry about?  

I have seen this world of startups for last 6+ years. Worked to run meetups in Kolkata for a couple years. But overall I have never been successful by industry standards. And that is great. I have scope to better my last time's plan then. Its an open ground, we are all players. So yeah we are going to rock, no doubt. Good luck to ourselves!  

**Edit**: I missed Paro. I am sure I missed a few other names.
