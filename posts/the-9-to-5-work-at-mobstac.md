We are preparing for our new product's launch at [TechCrunch Disrupt SF2011](http://disrupt.techcrunch.com/SF2011/) (Startup Alley) and to be honest we are fighting with all our might. The last 3 weeks have been really tough. Our product is a full HTML5 app, for a particular platform. What we are working on is honestly a bit of a challenge. The way we are doing stuff is not absolutely new, but at the same time its not easy.  

Thus in order to make sure we deliver the best within the timeline, we had to change what it means to be doing a 9 to 5 job. And by "we" I mean the full team including our CTO Ravi and CEO Sharat. We know we are doing something not easy and we are doing it from Bangalore\*, we do not have huge funds to hire every tech guru out there. So initially we started working 9AM - 6PM, which is typical, then increased to 9AM - 11PM, then to 9AM - 2AM, and finally on Thursday we did 9AM - 6:30AM. Yeah that gives a new meaning to the 9 to 5 job.

And yeah we loved it, and we are going to do that all over again as needed. Building a good product is tough, and we are not gonna say no.

\* *If you are wandering that I feel Bangalore is inferior to, say SF, that is not the case. But that said, I know that much of the technology "cloud" is created and bursts as rain in US. We only get the packaged drinking water version of it :) which takes some time to ship.*
