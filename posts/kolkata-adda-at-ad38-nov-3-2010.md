We have planned a Kolkata meetup (adda) at AD38, Salt Lake Sector 1, on November 3, 2010, from 6PM onwards. Its a no agenda meet, the original adda, Bengali format. With a traditional menu accompanying it:  

Luchi, Chola dal, Kosha mangsho, salad (type not yet fixed), mishti (probably pantua and rosogolla), chatni, papad.  

A few of us were discussing having a meet for sometime but we could not have it for past few months. So lets meet and have fun!  

Address is AD38, Salt Lake Sector 1.  

Its near No. 4 Water Tank, 10 mins from City Center Salt Lake.  

And if you know, its Pixlie and Web Prachar's office.
