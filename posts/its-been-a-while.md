Yes it has really been a while since I had blogged last. 2 years, according to the date on the previous post. I have been feeling to write for sometime now, but I guess the feeling was not strong enough to overcome the mental state of not blogging.  

I honestly do not know why I stopped blogging in the first place though. Anyway, no use thinking about that. I guess I will try and blog about what I have been doing all this while, what I have learnt, and am learning now. Let's see how quickly I can write up the first meaningful post now.
