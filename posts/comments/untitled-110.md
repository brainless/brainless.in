Good information on comparing these hosts. I had my [top web hosting](http://go-green-hosting.com/)on shared with Hostgator, however after a while I moved it to VPS, but my site kept crashing. I did alot of research and after moving through various host, I finally host with [top web hosting](http://go-green-hosting.com/). They provide quick support and also their server speed is pretty fast, I am quiet happy so far
