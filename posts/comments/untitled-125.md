BashCoder, no actually I had the throughput rates wrong there. In the next post I mentioned that :) 
Sorry for the confusion.

The actual rates are $0.01/hour for 50 Read units and $0.01/hour for 10 Write units.

You can check [the next post](/2012/01/schema-example-on-amazon-dynamodb.html) for details.
