If commentors hope to achieve links then they 
should at least show the intelligence to write a themed and considered 
comment. All comment spam does is hurt your backlinking efforts and 
creates worthless links. The realsafest way to be a success is to make 
friends with fellow bloggers who have blogs of a similar niche and hopefully 
generate actual targeted traffic by posting a detailed reply.
Maybe people will consider that prior to replying below me, I will not be holding my breath.
