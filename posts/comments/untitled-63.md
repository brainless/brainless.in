The amount of money given per wager is normally very small and sometimes varies with recreation choice. A on line casino might provide three comp factors for every $10 wagered on [1xbet](https://casino.edu.kg/1xbet.html) slots and one comp point for every $10 wagered on blackjack. This example is equal to returning zero.3% of wagers on slots and zero.1% of wagers on blackjack.
