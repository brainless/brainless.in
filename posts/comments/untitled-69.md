Hi,  
  
I am Anshuman kalla and like to learn languages. In this process I have taken up learning C++. By now I have learned C++ and searching for something interesting to take up. I am thinking to make 8085 mircorprocessor emulator myself using C++. I searched on internet to find some help. I found your project but it seems that links are not working. Could you please help me and give me idea to proceed. Also if you can provide me the active links.   
  
Thank you.   
Have a nice day!
